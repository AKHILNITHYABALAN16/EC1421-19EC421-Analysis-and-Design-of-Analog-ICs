## THEORY:
## NON - INVERTING AMPLIFIER:
If signal is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of op-amp without inverting the input signal such a circuit is called non-inverting amplifier. Here the output is feedback to the inverting input terminal. The phase shift of input signal does not occur in non-inverting terminal.
The circuit closed-loop voltage gain is

ACL = 1 + ( RF / R1)

## PROCEDURE:
### Non-Inverting Amplifier
1. Select R1 as a constant value and choose a value of Rf.
2. Connect the circuit as per as the circuit diagram.
3. Apply the constant amplitude input voltage to the circuit.
4. Measure the output voltage amplitude for different value of V1 from DSO.
5. Calculate the practical Voltage for different value of V1& compare it with theoretical output.
6. Practical gain & theoretical voltage should be approximately equal.
7. Plot the graph of the input wave versus output wave for any one practical case.

## RESULT:
Thus the Non-Inverting Amplifier are designed and their performance was successfully tested using op-amp IC 741.
